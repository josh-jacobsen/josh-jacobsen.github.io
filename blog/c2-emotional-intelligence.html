    <h2>Reflection on Chapter One of Search Inside Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      Despite what I initially thought, I am really enjoying Search Inside Yourself so far. I have attempted to read a couple of mindfulness books in the past and have always struggled to get past the first couple of pages.

      I think the difference with Search Inside Yourself has mainly to do with the author. Coming from an an engineering background, Meng is able to write in a down-to-earth, easy to understand manner. The way in which he provides quotes from different sources to highlight what he is saying, knowing that each member of his audience is likely to resonate more with one of them than the others, is testiment to this. An example of this is on page 66, when he defines the concept of mindfullness. He drawns upon Jon Kabat-Zinn and Thich Nhat Hanh to supply definitions of the concept, before telling us that he is drawn more to Kabat-Zinn's encapsulation as it is likely to resonate more with engineers (perhaps due to it's more sceintific langauage.)

      In paticular, I really like the quote from this chapter that comes from Viktor Frankl:<br>“Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our happiness.”<br>I find that I am often quick to react to emotions, and I anticipate that by reading this book, and carrying out the exercises within, that I will be able to temper this tendancy. This is probably the thing that I am looking forward to the most

      The first exercise from the book, the two minutes of mindfullness, I found quite interesting. I was sitting in a busy cafe (not the architypical setting for medidation), and decided to meditate the "Easy Way" (i.e. concentrating on my breath for two minutes). From yoga sessions that I have done, as well as one of the readings on meditation from last week, I know that one approach to meditation is to embrace the noise and activity that is going on around you. For my two minutes I focused on my breath, but did not worry too much that I could hear the music from the cafe, the conversations of the other customers, etc. I had my eyes closed and was just feeling how it was to sit and breath. Interestingly, after just those two minutes I felt more relaxed and calm.

      For next week I am going to incorporate the behavioural concept from BJ Fogg that we learnt last week to make 2 minutes of mindfullness part of my routine. I am going to find an activity that I already do as part of my day (maybe having a shower) and will tack on a 2 minute mindfullness exercise after that activity. Then I will congratulate myself on my acomplishment ;-)
