          <h6>1st May 2016</h6>
          <p>Reading chapter 6 of Search Inside Yourself prompted us to conduct an introspection exercise to examime what drives us as people, and the way in which we can align our passions with what we do.</p>
          <p>It got me thinking (as the author was probably hoping that it would) about where I am in life today, and specifically how I can see EDA contributing to the big picture of what it is that I want to achieve. The following is a quick overview of this.</p>
          <p>One of the big things that I would like to promote is financial literacy in NZ, and specifically knowledge of a comfort with the financial markets. While there are any number of programmes and resources focused on getting people to budget, save, etc., there is realtively less focused on getting people to invest in the stock market. There are groups like Snowball Effect promoting investment in businesses not yet listed on the NZX, which is a great thing, however not so much is being done on getting people to invest in companies already listed on the NZX. There are any number of educational products out there (www.invested.co.nz, etc.), however the process of getting set up with an equties trading account is no simplier.</p>
          <p>Overseas, companies like Robin Hood (in the US and Australia), making investing simple. You do everything that you need to from your phone, and there are no commisions to pay (in NZ the minimum amount charged in commision is 30 NZD; a complete rort).</p>
          <p>I'm starting to see how the tech skills that I'm gaining through EDA will help me to do something about an issue that I have wanted to address for a long time. I'm not quite sure exactly how this will work, but I'm a lot closer to making a difference than I was even a few short weeks ago.</p>
