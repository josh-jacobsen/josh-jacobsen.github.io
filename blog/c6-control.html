          <h5>Making Friends With Emotions</h5>
          <p>Chapter Five of Search Inside Yourself looked at emotional awarenesss and control. As with last week, the focus was on self-awareness when it comes to the emotions that are affecting you at any paticular time. This comes in most useful as times of stress and pressure, when often we feel like the emotions are taking over and may drive our actions and reactions to events, rather than the more rational side of our natures.</p>
          <p>For me the big takeaway was the importance of taking a pause when we feel our emotions rising (called the "sacred pause" in the book) in order to take a step back and critically examine what emotions we are feeling, and what may be driving them. This is something that has helped me in the past in situations of conflict. When reflecting on situations in my own life when I have used (as well as the times when I haven't) simlar techniques, I can see the utility of them.</p>
          <h5>Mindfulness Practise</h5>
          <p>With ongoing practise, I'm getting more and more out of each of the 2 minutes of mindfulness that I do. It isn't quite a habit yet (I still need a seperate trigger to remind me to do it), but I do notice and enjoy the feeling once I have done it.</p>
