          <h5 class="para">Compassionate Leadership (or counter-examples)</h5>
          <p class="prose">
            I've had the good fortune to do a number of things at a number of different organisations. This has come with the good fortune to work for, alongside, and with a whole range of people. In one of previous roles I worked for someone who, while being very good in a technical capacity, wasn't so great on the compassionate leadership side. Working for him was great on most aspects; I certainly learnt a lot, as he provided a really good personal development enviroment. On the downside, he was a little hard to communicate with on a personal level. He never seemed to be interested in anyone outside of a work enviroment: he wouldn't ask about plans for the weekend, how the family was, what you did after work the day before, or any of those other questions that keep the world turning on it's appropriate axis.
          </p>
          <p class="prose">
            Now this wasn't really his fault. I think that he just struggled to connect with people on a personal level (or maybe he just thought that making small talk about what you did outside of work was daft). Regardless of the cause, it did mean that when a difficult task came along, it was harder to stay motivated and work through it. The relative lack of personal connection with this person made it a less productive and altogether less fulfulling place to work. Compassionate leadership isn't just about making people happy (although that is a great aim). It's about getting the best out of people.

          <h5 class="para">The SCARF model</h5>
          <p class="prose">
            Reading Search Inside Yourself was the first place that I've come across the SCARF (Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness) model, but it immediatly made so much sense.
          </p>
          <p class="prose">
            Take status for example. We've all worked in teams where there has been some weird dynamics because people were jockying for status in the eyes of the boss. This can lead to some unusual situations: I was in a team once where a team member refused to hand over any work to the new hire. Rather than even out her workload so she wouldn't have to pull such late nights, she kept everything on her plate. At this time it made no sense, but in hindsight it was a status thing; she believed she would lose status if she were seen to be handing off work (implying that she couldn't do it). While this might seem unusual, it actually makes a great deal of sense when looking at it using the SCARF model. If it had been explained to my collegue in detail why someone was getting hired to help her (that it was simply due to workload as opposed to her competence), then maybe that transition could have gone much smoother than it did.
          </p>
          <p class="prose">
            I guess for us at EDA going in to Phase 1, it's about remembering that humans are complex creatures and often there might be a lot more going on with someone than just what you can pick up through talking with them (though talking with them is always a great place to start). If we're patient with each other and take the time to try and figure out where everyone else is coming from, then we'll be able to resolve the inevitable conflicts and differences of opinion without making each other cry. Much like you would hope that everyone would behave all the time &#9786;
