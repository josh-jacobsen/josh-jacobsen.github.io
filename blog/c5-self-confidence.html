          <h5>Mindfulness and Self-Awareness</h5>
          <p>
            Mindfulness is a prerequisite to self-awareness, as being mindful of our own state, be it mental, physical, emotional, is tantamount to self-awareness. The ability to critically analyse our emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and behavious, from a position of mindful non-judgement, is one of the hallmarks of a self-aware person.
          </p>
          <h5>Self-monitoring</h5>
          <p>
            The practise of body scanning is one that I have heard of before, however the techniques introduced in Search Inside Yourself and considerably more formal than those that I have encountered before. I derive a lot of benefit from body scanning, especially the portion on scanning for emotion. Often when I am feeling stressed or pressured I will go through an abbreviated form of a body scan in which I will critically examine how I am feeling and what is contributing to my emotions. I find this very useful, as it allows me to identify sources of stress, deal with them if I am able, and let go of them if they are outside of my control.
          </p>
          <h5>Me, my emotions, and the difference</h5>
          <p>
            I like the concepts that Search Inside Yourself raises when it comes to emotions, and specifically that "my emotions are not me". Saying that "I am angry", or "I am sad" has become so commonplace that we don't question the underlying assumption that this frame of reference introduces. Phrasing it like so reduces our focus on the ability that we have, and should exercise, to properly distance ourselves and resolve emotional reactions to events. Going forward I'm going to pay more attention to the way that I think of and refer to my emotions at any given time.
