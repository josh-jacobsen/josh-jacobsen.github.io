    <h2>Questions to Answer</h2>
    <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
    <p>HTML and CSS are the primary consituent parts of a website. A useful analogy is to this of these two as if you are building a house. HTML is the doors, windews, and other structural elements. CSS is how the hose is decorated. What colours the walls are, what furnishings are in the reom, ehat hte artwork on the walls is. HTML is what lays out the structue of a website.</p>

    <p>The Domain Object Model is used to describe something else, but I'm not quite sure what that is yet.</p>

    <p>When people talk about boxifying design, they are talking about the process of getting a design ready for being turned into a website. Becasue everthing in web design is about boxes, this process is the fist step in the journey from design to website.</p>

    <p>The box model is the model of the box which is used most of often in web design</p>
