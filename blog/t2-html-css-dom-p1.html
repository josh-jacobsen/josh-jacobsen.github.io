    <h2>Questions to Answer</h2>
    <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
    <p>The best analogy that I've so far heard for describing the interaction of HTML and CSS is the house model. When you build a website, HTML is used in the same way as the materials that you would use to build the structure of a house: the concrete poured on the driveway, the timber used to create to framework of the house, etc. CSS is what is placed over this structure to give it it's appearance: the paint used on the walls, the artwork placed in the living room, the carpet laid inside, etc.</p>

    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface used to describe the way that a document is acessed and interacted with. The DOM is used to represent the structure of the documents that it models. This structure "branches" downwards; in the DOM, documents have a structure that is very much like a tree</p>

    <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>

    <p>As everything in CSS is represented by a box, when people talk about boxifying a design they are talking about the process of breaking a design down into it's constituent "boxes", ready for being turned into a website. This is genearally the fist step in the journey from design to website.</p>

    <h3>What is the box model?</h3>

    <p>The box model is a term used in CSS to refer to design and layout. It is the model that wraps around every HTML element, and is comprised of the content, padding, border, and margin. It is this model which helps us to define the space between elements in a website, as well as the space around the element inside its box (the border).</p>
