    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <h3>1) What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>I am really looking forward to the next 4 months. I'm excited about what I'm going to learn, becasue everything that I have seen and heard about DBC/EDA thus far has been uniformly positive.</p>
    <h3>2) What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>DBC/EDA seem to have come up with a really sucessful model for teaching software development. I like the way that this is seen to be the first step on a decades-long process of learning, adapting, and improving as a developer. I like that fact that DBC/EDA sees graduates as good enough to "get paid to keep learning" by the end of the course.</p>
    <h3>3) How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>The type of culture that DBC/EDA promotes is the type that I most like interacting with. I really enjoy being given ownership of my own destiny, in that I get the feeling that the more that you put in to the course the more that you will grow and benefit as a developer.</p>
    <h3>4) Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>I wouldn't say that my expectations have changed per se, however I do have a greater apprecation and understanding for the way in which the course is structured. Initailly I was skeptical of the ammount of new material covered in Phase 0, as it seemed learning these things directly from an instructor would be better given the number of potential blockages. In listening to Sharif's fireside chat, it becomes apparant that it is beneficial to incorporate more material into Phase 0 to allow greater strides in learning from Phase 1 onwards. His example of learning to play scales in your own time before freestyle jamming with everyone as a group makes a lot of sense.</p>
    <h3>5) Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>I would say that I have a decent dose of the first type of fear (that others in my cohort are light-years ahead of me)! I know that it will be a lot of work to get through all the material that we will cover between now and July. I'm really keen on getting to grips with all this stuff though, as I know that getting into the work is what will settle the nerves down.</p>
