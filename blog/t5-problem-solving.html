          <h3 class="blog-title">Problem Solving</h3>
          <h5>Troubleshoting</h5>
          <p>
            Getting blocked on simple problems is pretty much a theme at this point in my programming career. One of the issues I struggled with in this week's Javascript assignment was how to use a for loop to assign Id's to each item in an array. The issue I had was how to write the expression that would assign the Id and that would change on each iteration. Each time I tried, it would either through an error and the page would not run, or else I would end up with each item getting the same Id, as the assignment statement would not change. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The way I ended up solving the problem was to create another array of Id's, then draw from this array to assign the Id's to each item. There is probably a more elegant way of solving the problem, but I was quietly stoked with this solution, as it had taken a significant ammount of work (googling, etc) to find. 
          </p>
          <h5>Problem Solving Techniques</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Pseudocode</em></li>
            <p>
              I don't really use pseudocode much at the moment. Its likely something that I'll start using more often in the future though
            </p>
            <li><em>Trying something</em></li>
            <p>
              This is my go-to method. Usually when I have a problem I will go back to the last point at which I has something working, and then use <em>console.log</em> to progressively step through the program, reading any <em>error messages</em> that come out
            </p>
            <li><em>Rubber ducky method</em></li>
            <p>
              I often suffer in silence until figuring out whats going on, though maybe this would be a good thing to try
            </p>
            <li><em>Googling</em></li>
            <p>
              This I do a lot of. Usually when I've gone through my troubleshooting routine of going back to the last point at which I had a working script and using console.log and reading the error messages, I will then take this information to Google and go through Stack Overflow and other sites, as for all the problems I'm encountering at the moment, there is usually something there
            </p>
            <li><em>Asking your peers and coaches for help</em></li>
            <p>
              As we go forward with the course I can see that asking peers and coaches is going to become a bigger part of my troubleshooting protocol
            </p>
            <li><em>Improving your process with reflection</em></li>
            <p>
              When I've solved a problem, I find that I will reflect on it at length and try and imagine other situations when the same thing might be effective
            </p> 
          </ul>
          
          <h5>Javascript functions</h5>

          <p>
            <strong>.map(): </strong> .map() takes a callback function and iterates through an array applying the callback function once to each element. It creates a new array with the results of the callback function. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>.filter(): </strong> .filter() takes a callback function and iterates through an array applying the callback function once to each element. It creates a new array with the elements of the array that passed the test provided by the callback function. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>.reduce(): </strong> .reduce() is a bit different, in that it can be used in a vareity of ways. Like the functions mentioned above, it applies a callback function to each element of an array. The return value is an accumulated total, which is then supplied as the argument for the next calback function.
