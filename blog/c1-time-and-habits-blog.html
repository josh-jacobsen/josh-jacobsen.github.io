    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <h3>1) Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is one that I generally use, although I did not know it existed as a acknowledged productivity approach before now. I find that I can concenrate for around 30 minutes before my mind starts to wander, so in the past I have notied when I lost concentration on the task at hand and permitted myself a "time out" for a few moments to unwind before coming back to the task. Having watched the Pomodoro Technique video, I have started setting a timer for 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5 minute break</p>
    <h3>2) What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>I thought that BJ Foggs presentation on creating new habits was facinating. Watching his explanation of motivation + ability + trigger = behaviour was interesting. I am going to try it out and see how it goes.</p>
    <h3>3) What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>I have found that approaching life with a growth mindset has helped me a great deal in past difficult situations. This is the first time that I have seen or heard someone mention that often people will hold (subconsciously) aspects of growth and fixed mindset about different aspects of thier lives. One of the things that I'm going to do going forward is to examine my perspective on various topics to see which mindset I have, and to reframe my thinking if I find I am holding on to a fixed mindset about an aspect of my life</p>
    <h3>4) Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>Meditation has been a subject that I have always been interested in, so I am going to use the Headspace app for the next week and see how it goes.</p>
