          <h5>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h5>
          <p>
            A responsive site is one that "responds" to the size of the display area of the device which is being used to acess the site. Given the wide range of devices that are being used these days to acess the internet, from small smart phones up to large screen TVs, developers must ensure that their sites will be acessable, readable, and navigatible to anyone.
          </p>
          <h5> What mobile first design is, and why is it important?</h5>
          <p>
            Mobile first design describes the process of developing a site to not only display well on the small screen of a moblie device, but also to load and fuction well on the restricted specifications of these devices. Developers can start with a relatively simple site and then use media queries to increase the complexity of the site in response to the size of the display that is being used to acess the site. This ensures that the most important information will always be aceessable, regardless of the device being used.
          </p>
          <h5>What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</h5>
          <p>
            When used in the context of web design, a framework is a cellection of files and folders of standadised code that can be used when developing websites. There are frameworks for front end development (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), back end deveopment (using Python, Ruby, etc.), and database management (using MySQL, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            Focusing on front end development, frameworks simplify the process of responsive web design. By supplying a collection of deployment-ready HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, they allow developers to produce responsive sites with a minumum of effort. They thus standadise, regulate, and simplify the process of developing clean, efficent, and responsive websites. They furthermore reduce the need for developers to rewrite the base code they use for each project.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the downside, often not all the code used in a framework will be usilised. They can thus result in a large ammount of left over code that can degrade the performace of a site. Like any prepared product, frameworks also reduce the requirement for developers to dive deep into the code and fully understand each and every item within.

          <p>
            A wireframe is a basic diagram of the layout of a web page that demonstrates what interface elements will exist on key pages. It is generally left intentionallly rough-and-ready, so that feedback can focus on page content, layout, and usability rather than other aspects such as image or colour selection.
            They provide a  meaningful road map for site development while being simple enough to produce quickly.

          <h5>What were the aspects of the wireframes that I found difficult to implement?</h5>
          <p>
            The hardest aspect to implement from my wireframe so far has been the nav bar. In keeping with my tendancy to get lost in rabbit holes trying to get that widget to do that thing that I want, getting the nav menu to even remotely resemble what I'm trying to do was a major undertaking. On the positive side of all that though, I'm starting to feels as though when something goes wrong, or I'm just trying to figure out something new, I am getting much better at knowing what types of questions I should be asking.
