               How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
               Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
               Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.
               Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
          </p>

          <p>
            This week we began to cover Javacript, to supplement our nacent knowledge of HTML and CSS. If we think of HTML as a human body and CSS as the clothes that we cover the body in to give it a presentable appearance, then Javacript are the nerve, tendons and ligaments that enable the body (and the clothes that cover it) to respond to inputs and stimulus. For example if the nerves of the body register pain, the reaction, transmitted through the nerves and tendons, is to pull that body part away. Javascript functions in the same way to cause a website to react on input from mouse clicks, scrolling, and similar stimulus. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Control flow and loops in Javacript can be likened to eating at a buffet while hungry.

            1) Ask the question: Are you hungry? 
              If yes, go to step 2. 
              If no, then go to the counter and pay 

            2) Put food on plate. 

            3) Ask the question: Is this sufficient food? 
              a) If no, contiune putting food on plate 
                 Then ask the question again 
              b) If yes, sit down and eat food. 

            4) After eating food, return to the question 1. If still hungry, repeat last sequence. If not, then pay for food and leave

            In order to sustain my practise of medidation, I am likely to use the second method suggested, that of doing less that you are actually able to do. In fact this is what I do at the moment. I have found that 2 minutes of meditation is a good period for me at the moment. While I could sustain a longer period of medidation, 2 minutes is much eaiser to achive. I will keep it at this length until I have built up the habit of regular medidation. By the time I have made meditation part of my daily routiene, it is likely that I will want to increase the length of time that I spend doing it on each iteration. If I was to force myself to meditate for longer at this stage, I run the risk of becoming bored and abandoning the activity in favour of something else.

            I like the concent that Meng raised in this chapter of walking medidation. I already find that going for a walk is a good way for me to create space to think through and process things that are going on in my life. I can see how I can eaisily incorporate some of the aspects of walking medidation into something that I already do (my focusing on lifting my feet, the weight transfer that happens, etc.). The next time that I am walking somewhere, I am going to try to incorporate some of the aspects of walking meditation.
