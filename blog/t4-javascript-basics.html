          <p>
            This week our focus shifted from studying HTML and CSS to Javascript. While at this stage we're getting our heads around the syntax and usage of the language, I'm looking forward to implmenting some Javascript around the site. When thinking about the relationshipt between HTML, CSS and Javascript, a useful anology is one of a living organism such as a person. If we think of HTML as the body CSS as the clothes that the body, then Javacript can be thought of as the nerves, tendons and ligaments that enable the body (and the clothes that cover it) to respond to inputs and stimulus. For example if the nerves of the body register pain, the reaction, transmitted through the nerves and tendons, is to pull that body part away. Javascript functions in the same way to cause a website to react on input from mouse clicks, scrolling, and similar stimulus.

          <h5>Control Flow</h5>
          <p>
            Control flow and loops are structures used to control actions in a Javascript program. They perform actions if certain prerequisites are met. We can use the example of eating at a buffet as a way of demonstrating control flow and loops. 
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <pre>
              <code>

  1) Ask the question: Are you hungry? 
    If yes, go to step 2. 
    If no, then go to the counter and pay 

  2) Put food on plate. 

  3) Ask the question: Is this sufficient food? 
    a) If no, contiune putting food on plate, 
    and re-ask the question 
    b) If yes, sit down and eat food. 

  4) After eating food, return to the question 1. If still 
  hungry, repeat last sequence. If not, then pay for food 
  and leave   
                
              </code>
            </pre>

          </blockquote>
        
          <h5>
            Objects and Arrays
          </h5>

          <p>
            In Javascript, an object is a data type; it is an unordered list of data stores as a series of name(or key)-value pairs.  

            We could create an object that contains my personal data for example. That my first name is Josh, I like at the 2nd house on my street, my favourite colour is blue, and the type of car I drive is a Hyundai. The syntax for creating this object would look something like:
          </p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <pre>
              <code>
    var josh = {
    firstName: "Josh";
    favColour: "blue";
    houseNum: 2;
    carType: "Hyundai";
    }
              </code>
            </pre>
          </blockquote>  
           
          
          <p>
            To access data from an object we refer to the "named index" that contains the property that we want. We do this using either dot or bracket notation which relates to the index we are trying to access. For example using the following code:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>
              <code>
  var name = josh.firstName and 
  var name = josh("firstName") 
                
              </code>
            </pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p> 
            Would both result in the new variable "name" having the value "Josh" assigned to it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            An array on the other hand is a list-like type of object that are used to store multiple values in a single object.  

            To create an array of fruit for example, we could write the followinng code:

            var fruit = [banana, pear, orange, apple]; 

            Arrays use "numbered indexes" to retrieve data, in contrast to the "named indexes" of objects. Numbers in arrays start from 0, so to access the value "banana" we would write something like:
            var iFeelLike = fruit[0]
          </p>
          <h5>Functions in Javascript</h5>
          <p>
            Functions in Javacript are blocks of code written to perform a certain task (or function). They are useful in that they allow a peice of code to be written once and then called multiple other times throughout a program.
