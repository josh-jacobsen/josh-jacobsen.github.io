    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
    <p>Grid based design describes the process of using a grid to layout the content of a website. This provides a good visual and structural balance when creating a website. They allow web designers to systimatically craft well-organized layouts, and provide the user with a predictable pattern to follow as they use the site.</p>
    <h3>What is all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
    <p>Responsive webpages change to accomodate screens of different dimentions (in pixels, as oppossed to the physical size of the screen itself). A related concept is adaptive design, which is the process of ensuring websites are able to be manipulated by users on differnet devices, who may be using thumbs to navigate, as opposed to a mouse.</p>
    <h3>What is Semantic Structure?</h3>
    <p>Semantic structure uses semantic elements to give structure to the webpage that gives meaning to both the browser and the developer. The use of tags such as article, section, table, and img clearly define the content of the sections. There are benefits for search engines that are now able to correctly identify webpage content</p>
    <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h3>
    <p>I came away from this lesson with a much better understanding of how to go about laying out, and then filling in, a webpage. This has given me a much clearner picture of how to go about improving my project.</p>
