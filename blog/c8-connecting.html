          <h5>Politcal Awareness</h5>
          <p>While I have usually been pretty good at trying to understand where people are coming from on a one-to-one level, it wasn't until I started working in a politically complex orgainsation a bit later in life that I began to appreciate how important it is to "scale up" your empathy to be able to understand the enviroment created by the intersection of the self-intrest of individuals, the intrests of various teams, and the intrest of the orgainsation as a whole. This political awareness is vital for a long career in any orgainsation, as it allows you to get people of all levels on side to help with getting things done.</p>
          <p>I was most fortunate that when I got to a position where this type of political awareness was necessary, I was working for a person who was an absolute master when it came to navigating politically complex enviroments. He took the time to get to know people around him on a personal level (he was genuinely intrested in other people and their wellbeing), which gave him a great advantage when it came to getting things done at work.</p>
          <p>Becasue of a rather unusual orgainsational structure, my boss often needed people to want to help him get his job done, even if at times this went against their self-intrest. By getting to know people and understand what their drivers were, my boss was able to get people on his side, to the extent that they would go out of their way to help him. When going in to a meeting where he was going to propose a course of action, he would have done a significant amount of work meeting with the key players who would be there and convincing them that his course of action was a good idea.</p>
          <p>When the meeting happened, he would therefore be presenting an idea that people in the room had been presented with before-hand. Those who would be affected had been throughly breifed in advance, and any misgivings had been addressed. In an organisation where a lot of good ideas didn't go any further than the talking stage due to internal political issues, my boss was one of the most effective people in the orgainsation. For me, it was a masterful demonstration in the importance of having the abilty to empathise with people on an individual level and use this understanding to build up political awareness.</p>
