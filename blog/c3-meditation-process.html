          <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
          <p>
            I'm not going to lie, I had significant difficulties with the process over product approach this week. I like to explore subjects in depth and I often find myself asking "why" a lot and wanting to know more about paticular points within a topic. This approach posed several problems to me this week, as process over product in my case meant just accepting some things as a given so I could move on to developing the other aspects of my site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best example of this was when I was creating the navigation menu for my site. From my wireframing and looking at other sites for inspiration, I have a really good idea of what I want to achieve. Having gotten 80% of the way there, I then spent a significant ammount of time trying to get the rest of the 20% compelted, instead of acknowleging that the nav menu was "fit for purpose" in it's current state and carparking the issue for later development once I had completed all the other tasks for the week (such as the blog posts and reflections).

          <h5>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
          <p>
            I guess that I was under the assumption that mediation was something that takes a lot of time to do properly (as in a one hour mediation session as a minimum), and that having your attention wander during a meditation session is by definition a negative thing.
          </p>
          <h5>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h5>
          <p>
            I like the way in which Meng described the process of recapturing lost attention as a way of strengthing your brain and meta-attention. This is a different way of looking at one of the biggest issues that I have faced in the past with maintaining attention (it often feels like I can't focus on my breathing, or whatever it happens to be that I am trying to focus on). Now when this happens I look at it as an opportunity to develop a weakness, instead of castigating myself for having let it happen.
          </p>
          <h5> Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
          <p>
            Coming up with my position for meditating is a great idea. Thinking of whatever position that I end up adopting as having to be one in which I feel "majestic, dignified, and awe-inspiring" gives me the abilty to play around with a number of options while ensuring that I have a goal in mind while doing so. So far I have found the best position for me to be on a bean bag in the middle of the living room floor.
          </p>
          <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
          <p>
            Going back to BJ Fogg's teachings on developing habits by linking them to existing behaviours, I'm going to aim to do 2 minutes of meditation every time that I put the kettle on during the working day. Keeping it at 2 minutes is easily achieveable (the 10 minutes that I did while reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself was getting to be on the long side for my current state of meditation-realted ability), and putting on the kettle has become a regualr habit while working from home, so if I can get some additional benefit out of the activity then so much the better.
