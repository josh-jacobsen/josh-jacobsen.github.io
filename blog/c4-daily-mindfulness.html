          <p>
            I recently finished having a "mindfulness conversation" with my partner, having read Chapter 3 of book "Search Inside Yourself" from Chade-Meng Tan. The first thing we found is that 4 minutes is a remarkably long time (well, so it seems) to speak uninteruppted. These days we get so used to rapid conversations and interjections that we tend to rush to get to the point of what we are trying to say. Being able to "relax" more when speaking was a refreshing change. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My partner likewise appreciated the space to be able to formulate her thoughts and take a moment of silence if necessary to think about the best way to articulate a point without me jumping in to offer suggestions. We think that this is something that we are going to look at doing more often going forward. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to sustain my practise of medidation, I am likely to use the second method suggested, that of doing less that you are actually able to do. In fact this is what I do at the moment. I have found that 2 minutes of meditation is a good period for me at the moment. While I could sustain a longer period of medidation, 2 minutes is much eaiser to achive. I will keep it at this length until I have built up the habit of regular medidation. By the time I have made meditation part of my daily routiene, it is likely that I will want to increase the length of time that I spend doing it on each iteration. If I was to force myself to meditate for longer at this stage, I run the risk of becoming bored and abandoning the activity in favour of something else. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I like the concent that Meng raised in this chapter of walking medidation. I already find that going for a walk is a good way for me to create space to think through and process things that are going on in my life. I can see how I can eaisily incorporate some of the aspects of walking medidation into something that I already do (my focusing on lifting my feet, the weight transfer that happens, etc.). The next time that I am walking somewhere, I am going to try to incorporate some of the aspects of walking meditation.
